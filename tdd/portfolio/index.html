      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="block"></div>
      <p>I am a full-stack software developer living in Broomfield, CO. I have been programming full-time for over 2 years now, but my first real exposure to coding was learning Python for a Bioinformatics class during my graduate work in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Code is everywhere, and I've found a passion for code and the web.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3><span class="typcn typcn-spiral icon"></span>My Philosophy</h3>
      <p>As a scientist, I'm believe in experimentation. Experimentation requires testing, validation, and adaptation. Build first, then test. All code is a living experiment; there's always room for adaption and improvement.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3><span class="typcn typcn-puzzle icon"></span>My Goals</h3>
      <p>I'm currently looking for a new position where I can tackle new challenges and learn new technologies. Specifically, I would like to find a front-end developer position on a team where I can learn and use a modern component library like React or Vue.</p>
